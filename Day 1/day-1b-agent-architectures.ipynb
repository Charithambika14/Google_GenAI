For thirty years, this lonely tower had been his world. Tonight, however, felt different. A storm, unlike any he’d weathered, raged outside, yet within the stone walls, an unusual stillness prevailed. While relighting the lamp after a brief flicker, his hand brushed against a loose stone in the wall. Curiosity piqued, he pried it free. Behind it lay a tightly rolled parchment, brittle with age. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. It wasn't paper, but some leathery material, inscribed with glowing, sapphire-blue lines that pulsed with a faint, internal light.

Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen Elias's Characterization:** While we understand Elias is a lonely lighthouse keeper, we don't yet see much of his personality beyond his duty. Briefly hint at what he *yearns* for or what his life has lacked. For example, what does this \"forgotten part of his soul\" yearn for specifically? More interaction with the world, adventure, connection? This will make his discovery more impactful.\n\n2.  **Enhance the Sensory Experience:** The description of the map is excellent, but consider adding more sensory details to Elias's immediate surroundings to contrast with the map's otherworldly nature. What does the storm *sound* like inside the tower? Is there a particular smell of the old parchment? The \"unusual stillness\" is a good start, but grounding the scene with more tangible sensory input will make the magical elements stand out even more.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Hint of Foreshadowing or Conflict:** The storm is mentioned, but it feels external to Elias's personal discovery. Could the storm somehow be connected to the map, or could the map itself present an immediate, albeit subtle, challenge? For instance, as he unrolls it, does a gust of wind inexplicably blow through the seemingly sealed lantern room, or does a symbol on the map briefly flare brighter, causing a physical sensation for Elias? This would immediately raise the stakes and integrate the external environment with the internal discovery.\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the damp salt-spray from the lantern room window, the beam cutting a familiar swathe through the inky black. For thirty years, this lonely tower had been his world, a solitary sentinel against the churning sea. He’d long resigned himself to a life of quiet routine, though a flicker of something more – a yearning for a world beyond the horizon, for a connection he’d never known – sometimes stirred in the quiet hours. Tonight, however, felt different. A storm, unlike any he’d weathered, raged outside, the wind a mournful howl that seemed to vibrate through the very stone, and the waves crashed against the base of the tower with a violence that shook the floor. Yet, within the lantern room, an unusual stillness prevailed, a pocket of calm amidst the tempest.\n\nWhile relighting the lamp after a brief, unsettling flicker, his hand brushed against a loose stone in the wall. It felt strangely warm. Curiosity, a long-dormant companion, piqued. He pried it free, the grinding sound swallowed by the storm’s roar. Behind it lay a tightly rolled parchment, brittle with age, and emitting a faint, ozone-like scent mixed with the brine. Unfurling it, Elias gasped, his breath catching in his throat. It wasn't paper, but some leathery material, inscribed with glowing, sapphire-blue lines that pulsed with a faint, internal light. The lines formed a map, impossibly intricate, depicting islands shaped like celestial beasts floating in an obsidian sea. As Elias gazed, mesmerized, a symbol near the center of the map flared brighter, and a phantom gust of wind, smelling faintly of exotic blossoms, whipped through the lantern room, though no window or door was open. The parchment grew warmer beneath his touch, the blue lines seeming to writhe, singing to that forgotten part of his soul, promising adventure, connection, and a world far stranger and more wondrous than he had ever dared to imagine.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
